# AWS Crypto Tools

We build open source cryptographic libraries that are easy to use, and hard to misuse.
Cryptography is hard to do safely and correctly.
Our libraries are designed to help you do cryptography right, even without special expertise.
Our client-side encryption libraries help you to protect your sensitive data
at its source using secure cryptographic algorithms, envelope encryption, and signing.

## AWS Encryption SDK
The AWS Encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library
designed to make it easy for you to encrypt and decrypt data using industry standards and best practices.
It enables you to focus on the core functionality of your application,
rather than on how to best encrypt and decrypt your data.

- [Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java)
- [Javascript (Beta)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-javascript)
- [Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/)

### AWS Encryption CLI
You can use the AWS Encryption CLI to encrypt and decrypt files and directories with the AWS Encryption SDK.

## AWS DynamoDB Encryption Client
The Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client is a software library
that helps you to protect your table data before you send it to Amazon DynamoDB.

- [Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-dynamodb-encryption-python)

## Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (ACCP)
ACCP implements the standard Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) interfaces
and replaces the default Java cryptographic implementations
with those provided by libcrypto from the OpenSSL project.
ACCP allows you to take full advantage of
assembly-level and CPU-level performance tuning,
to gain significant cost reduction, latency reduction, and higher throughput.
