# AWS Crypto Tools

We make open source cryptographic libraries that are easy to use, and hard to misuse. Cryptography is hard to do safely and correctly. Our libraries are designed to help everyone do cryptography right, even without special expertise. Our client-side encryption libraries help you to protect your sensitive data at its source using secure cryptographic algorithms, envelope encryption, and signing. 

## AWS Encryption SDK
The AWS Encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library designed to make it easy for to encrypt and decrypt data using industry standards and best practices. It enables you to focus on the core functionality of your application, rather than on how to best encrypt and decrypt your data. 

The AWS Encryption SDK is currently available in the following languages:
- [C](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-c)
- [Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java)
- [Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-python/)
- [Javascript (Beta)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-javascript)

## AWS DynamoDB Encryption Client
- [Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-dynamodb-encryption-java)
